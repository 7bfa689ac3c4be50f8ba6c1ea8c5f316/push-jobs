config_file_option = "-c #{PushJobsHelper.config_path}"

# The Parameters key isn't respected by some versions. Inject the
# config file path into ImagePath.
#
# This is a bit painful, since ImagePath contains a version specific
# path to the windows_service.rb code; we can't know what it is until
# the msi is installed. (The path incorporates the push-client ruby
# gem version, which isn't always correlated with the version of the
# omnibus package. So we can't create this entry before installation,
# yet installation may fail if this isn't set.
#
# The approach below parses the ImagePath from the installer, and adds
# a command line option to point to the config file.
