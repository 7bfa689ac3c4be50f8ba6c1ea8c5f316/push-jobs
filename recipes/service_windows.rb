# The ImagePath looks like "X:\Path\To\ruby.exe X:\Path\To\windows_service.rb"
# The MSI does not pass any other arguments. So we match the above
# path, just to be extra careful, and then append the "-c path\to\config"
# to it. We need to restart the windows service after performing this
# to ensure that the change takes effect.
#
# If this registry key doesn't exist, then the service has not been
# registered yet and an appropriate error will be thrown when
# a service restart is attempted.
